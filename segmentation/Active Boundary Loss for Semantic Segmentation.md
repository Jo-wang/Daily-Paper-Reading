- the segmentation results might be blurred and lack Ô¨Åne object boundary details
- boundary-aware information Ô¨Çow control and multi-task training methods have been proposed to improve the discriminative power of features belonging to different objects
- there still exist a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of segmentation errors at object boundaries, especially for small and thin objects
- Main Steps:
  - for a pixel on the PDBs (predicted boundaries), we Ô¨Årst determine a direction pointing to the closest GTB (gt boundaries) pixel
  - then move the PDB at this pixel towards the direction in a probabilistic manner
  - detach the gradient Ô¨Çow to suppress possible conÔ¨Çicts
