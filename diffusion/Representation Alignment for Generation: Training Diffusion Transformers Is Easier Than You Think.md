## [Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06940)
Arxiv

Ranking: 5

### Introduction and background
- we identify that the main challenge in training diffusion models stems from the need to learn a high-quality internal representation h.
- We demonstrate that the training process for generative diffusion models becomes significantly easier and more effective when supported by an external representation, $$y_*$$.
