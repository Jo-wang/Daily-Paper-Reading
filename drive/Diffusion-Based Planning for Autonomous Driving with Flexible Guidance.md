## [Diffusion-Based Planning for Autonomous Driving with Flexible Guidance](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wM2sfVgMDH)

ICLR 2025

Ranking: 3

### Introduction and background
- Human drivers exhibit multi-modal behaviors, but behavior cloning struggles to model such complexity, even with large transformer models or multi-trajectory sampling.
- In out-of-distribution scenarios, directly using model outputs leads to poor planning, often requiring fallback to rule-based methods, which inherit their limitations.
- Imitation learning alone is insufficient to capture the diversity of driving behavior; using auxiliary losses to penalize unsafe plans can cause objective conflicts and fails to teach recovery from mistakes.
- Well-trained models lack adaptability, making it difficult to modify behaviors for specific requirements.
