Ranking: :star: :star: :star: :star:

### Introduction and background

- Instance segmentation requires costly annotations such as bounding boxes and segmentation masks for learning.

- We propose a fully unsupervised learning method that learns class-agnostic instance segmentation without any annotations.

- Freesolo is a novel localization-aware pre-training framework

- it contains two major pillars: Free Mask and Self-supervised SOLO
