### Introduction and background
- it is challenging to predict instance labels on pixel-level
- Previous methods is "detect-then-segment" e.g., Mask R-CNN; or, predict embedding vectors first then use clustering techniques to group pixels into individual instances
- Previous methods are step-wise and indirect, which either heavily rely on accurate bounding box detection or depend on per-pixel embedding learning and the grouping processing

- SOLO can directly segment the instance masks.
