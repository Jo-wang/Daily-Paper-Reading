### Introduction and background
- it is challenging to predict instance labels on pixel-level
- Previous methods is "detect-then-segment" e.g., Mask R-CNN, PANet, Mask Scoring R-CNN, HTC; or, predict embedding vectors first then use clustering techniques to group pixels into individual instances, e.g., SGN, SSAP
- Previous methods are step-wise and indirect, which either heavily rely on accurate bounding box detection or depend on per-pixel embedding learning and the grouping processing

- SOLO can directly segment (e.g., AdaptIS, PolarMask) the instance masks.End-to-end.

- Divide the image into uniform grids (S*S). If the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for

  - predicting the semantic category (belongs to which class, output is SSC.
  - segmenting that object instance (the seg map, $H_I\times W_I\times S^2$)
  each positive grid cell will generate the corresponding instance mask
  (grid (i,j) is considered as a positive sample if it falls into the center region of any ground truth mask)
  This mask cannot be generated by FCNs since we need position sensitive in instance segmentation
