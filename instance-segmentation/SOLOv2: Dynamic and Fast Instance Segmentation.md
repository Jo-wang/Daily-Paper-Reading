⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐

### Introduction and background
- bounding boxes are coarse and unnatural
- most existing methods deal with instance segmentation in the view of bounding boxes
- For box-free SOLO, three main bottlenecks limit its performance: 
  - a) inefficient mask representation and learning; 
  - b) not high enough resolution for finer mask predictions; 
  - c) slow mask NMS.

### Method
#### Mask Learning

#### Matrix NMS

### Experiments
