### Introduction and background
- Previous work say feature statistics (mean and standard deviation) **carry informative domain characteristics** of the training data.
- :star: To define domain characteristic: the information that is more specific to the individual domains but less relevant to the task objectives.
- Consequently, domains with different data distributions generally have inconsistent feature statistics 
- Uncertain statistics shifts:

- In this paper, to improve the generalization ability, they are trying to properly modeling **Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU)**, i.e., characterizing the feature statistics as uncertain distributions.
