## [Cycle Self-Training for Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03571)
NeurIPS 2021

Ranking: 4.5
### Introduction and background
1. Self-training with pseudo labeling is a replacement of original feature alignment in domain adaptation.
2. Pseudo-labels are unreliable:
    -  pseudo-labels are biased towards several classes due to domain shift
    -  the denoising ability of pseudo-labels in standard self-training is hindered by domain shift
