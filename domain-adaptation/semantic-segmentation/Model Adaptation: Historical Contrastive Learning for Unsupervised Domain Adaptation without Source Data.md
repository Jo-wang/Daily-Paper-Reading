Ranking: ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐

### Introduction and background
- This paper is mainly focusing on unsupervised model adaptation (another name of source-free DA ❓) to adapt source-trained models to ﬁt target data distribution without accessing the source-domain data.
- This setting alleviates the concern of data privacy and intellectual property effectively.
- More challenging and susceptible to collapse.
