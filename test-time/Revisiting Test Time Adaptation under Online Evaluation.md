## [Revisiting Test Time Adaptation under Online Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04795)


### Introduction and background
- Current evaluation protocols overlook the effect of this extra computation cost, affecting their real-world applicability.
- To address this issue, we propose a more realistic evaluation protocol for TTA methods where data is received online from a constant-speed data stream, thereby accounting for the methodâ€™s adaptation speed.

- Offline: only update the one who faces the time step. Otherwise, output the prediction without updating the parameter.

- Online: measure the speed of the method processing data x as R; R will join the speed measuring process. (because some methods process data depending on the data itself, the time to process each piece of data is different.)
