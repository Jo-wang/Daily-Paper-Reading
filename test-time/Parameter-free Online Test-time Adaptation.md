CVPR2022

### Introduction and background
- Existing test-time adaptation methods such as TENT and SHOT may not be effective for all scenarios because they do not explicitly study the extent to which their approach works across training strategies and architectures. 
- The type of model being adapted is a variable that strongly affects the effectiveness of both TENT and SHOT. 
- Additionally, these methods may over-adapt the model parameters, leading to poor performance or even catastrophic degradation of performance. 
- **In this paper**, LAME runs efficient while requiring less memory than NAMs. 
- It's provide a correction of the output probabilities.
