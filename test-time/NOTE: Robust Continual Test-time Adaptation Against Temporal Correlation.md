**Main Task:** present a new test-time adaptation scheme that is robust against non-i.i.d.
test data streams (with the time t changes)

### Introduction and background
- performance degrades under distributional shifts between the training data and test data
- previous work assume ($x_t, y_t$) i.i.d. drawn from $P_T (x,y)$
- However, the distribution of online test samples often changes across the time axis, i.e., ($x_t, y_t$) âˆ¼ $P_T (x,y|t)$ in many applications

- the existing model might be biased towards these imbalanced samples under the temporally correlated test streams
