## [Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07736)


### Introduction and background
- First, adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead to error accumulation.
- Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in practice.

### Method

### Experiments
