ICML2020

Could be OTTA 

### Introduction and background
- 1. Traditional machine learning assumes that training and test data come from the same distribution, which may not be true in practice.
- 2. Distribution shifts can occur due to changes in the environment, sensor noise, or other factors.
- 3. Existing methods for addressing distribution shifts include domain adaptation and meta-learning, but these methods have limitations.
- 4. Test-Time Training (TTT) is a novel approach that leverages self-supervised learning to adapt to distribution shifts at test time.
- 5. TTT has several advantages over existing methods, including simplicity, flexibility, and effectiveness on diverse image classification benchmarks.
