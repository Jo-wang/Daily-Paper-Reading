### Introduction and background
- Real-world non-stationary streaming data usually are highly uncertain in their temporal dynamics
- Only partial observation of the time series or the local streams is available, resulting in poor alignment quality.
- To solve the first problem, formulating internal predictive modeling as a continuous-time Bayesian filtering problem within a stochastic dynamical system context.
- To solve the second problem: perform UDA on the entire data generation mechanism, which is described by a latent stochastic process conditioned on historical data. particle filter differential equation (PFDE)
