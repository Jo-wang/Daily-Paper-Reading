## [MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=N92hjSf5NNh)

ICLR2023 Poster

### Introduction and background
- Previous TTA such as Tent gains OOD performance via online optimization which is accompained by large memory consumption and are prohibitive in many real-world Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) applications. 
- To overcome this challenge, we need to improve the acc via reduce the memory cost.
- Mainly ofcusing on cache of BP (i.e., batch size, channel and layer number)
