### Introduction and background
- test-time BN are completely affected by the currently received test samples, resulting in inaccurate estimates.
- parameter update is biased towards some dominant classes
- the defects can be exacerbated in more complicated test environments, such as (time) dependent or class-imbalanced data
- previous approaches work well in certain scenarios while show performance degradation in others due to their faults
