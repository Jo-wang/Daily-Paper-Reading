### Method
- For TTT tasks, still use the way that trains both the main task and the self-supervised task during training while only finetuning the self-supervised task during testing and then getting the test prediction by the main task.
- This paper uses spatial autoencoding to remove parts of the data for the self-supervised task, and then predict the removed content.
