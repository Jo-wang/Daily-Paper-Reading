## [On Pitfalls of Test-time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03536.pdf)

ICML2023

### Introduction and background
- The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges and limitations of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) in machine learning. 
- The authors aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the pitfalls of TTA and propose a benchmark library, called TTAB, to standardize experimental settings and evaluate the effectiveness of TTA algorithms across a broader range of base models and distribution shifts. 
- The authors hope that their work will not only facilitate rigorous evaluations of TTA algorithms but also stimulate further research into the assumptions that underpin the viability of TTA in challenging scenarios.
