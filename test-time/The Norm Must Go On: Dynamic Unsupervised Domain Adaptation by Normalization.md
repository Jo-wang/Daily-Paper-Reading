### Introduction and background
- This paper focusing on OTTA: continuous dynamic adaptation
- Related approaches typically ignore the training statistics and recalculate the batch statistics from scratch for the test data, which requires large batches of test data.
- This work require only a small number of sequential samples (less than 1% of unlabeled test data)
- This work requires no back propogation.
