## [A Probabilistic Framework for Lifelong Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09713)

CVPR2023

### Introduction and background
- Previous works assume the target domain is stationary, but test input distribution may exhibit a lifelong/continual shift over time.
- Existing TTA approaches also lack the ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, which is crucial when distribution shifts occur between the source and target domain.

### Method

### Experiments
- Setting: continual/gradual adaptation
- Dataset: CIFAR10C/100C; ImageNet-C; ImageNet3DCC
