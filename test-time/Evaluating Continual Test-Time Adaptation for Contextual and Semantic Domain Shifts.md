## [Evaluating Continual Test-Time Adaptation for Contextual and Semantic Domain Shifts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08767.pdf)


### Introduction and background
- Contextual shifts correspond to the types of environments; for example, a model pre-trained in an indoor context has to adapt to the outdoor context on CORe-50.
- Semantic shifts correspond to the capture types; for example, a model pre-trained on natural images has to adapt to clipart, sketches, and paintings on DomainNet.
- Conclusion:
  - i) Test-time adaptation methods perform better and forget less about contextual shifts compared to semantic shifts
  - ii) TENT outperforms other methods on short-term adaptation, whereas CoTTA outperforms other methods on long-term adaptation
  - iii) BN is the most reliable and robust
