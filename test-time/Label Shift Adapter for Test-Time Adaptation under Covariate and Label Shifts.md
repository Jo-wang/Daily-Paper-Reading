- The previous method has temporal correlation, etc. Still, it does not cover the situation where the source domain data has a long-tailed label distribution, which can lead to bias in the source model. 
- Furthermore, we observed that training the source model on a long-tailed dataset with long-tailed recognition techniques, such as balanced softmax, is
insufficient to stabilize TTA algorithms.
