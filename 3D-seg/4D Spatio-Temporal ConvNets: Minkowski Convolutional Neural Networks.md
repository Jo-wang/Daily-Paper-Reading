## [4D Spatio-Temporal ConvNets: Minkowski Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08755)

CVPR 2019

Ranking: 4.5

### Introduction and background
- 3D is used in robotics system or AR/VR applications
- LiDAR is affordable and widely used in robotics
- But dealing with these kinds of data is challenging:
  1. 3D needs heterogeneous representation, not user friendly
  2. difficult to integate into larger system
  3. 3D convolutional neural net not very well inproved compared with 2D one
  4. there is not many open-source library
